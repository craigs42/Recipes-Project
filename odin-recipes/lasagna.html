        <li>1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 15oz cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 pound mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated parmasean cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound lasagna noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375° F.</li>
        <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add in onion and saute 2-3 minutes. Add in garlic and ground beef. Break meat apart as it browns. Once meat has browned completely, pour in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, bay leaves, dried basil, sugar, Italian Seasoning and salt. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Cook sauce 1-2 hours or until very thick. You may have to add a little extra water as it reduces down to prevent scorching. This is normal.</li>
        <li>While meat sauce cooks, make the cheese layer: stir cheeses together in a bowl with basil, parsley and salt & pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles 2/3 of the time marked on the package. About 7 minutes or so. Drain and place noodles in a large bowl of cold water.</li>
        <li>Cover lasagna with greased foil. Bake at 375° F for 45 minutes with foil on. Remove foil and bake another 15 minutes or until cheese has browned and everything it hot all the way through. Remove from oven, cover lightly with foil and rest 20-30 minutes before cutting and serving. Sprinkle with dried basil or parsley flakes, cut into squares and serve.</li>
